# Digital Products Aggregator

## Overview

The Digital Products Aggregator is an application designed to aggregate and normalize product data from multiple external providers, simulating real-world scenarios with dynamic pricing and inconsistent data structures. The application consists of two key modules:

1. **Provider Module**
2. **Product Module**

A core concept in this application is the **UPC ID**, a unique identifier assigned to a product. Different providers may list the same product under different external IDs but will share the same UPC ID if itâ€™s the same product.

The primary goal of the product aggregation API is to:

- Collect data from multiple providers.
- Process and transform this data into a uniform structure (Product DTO).
- Serve the normalized product information through a set of APIs.

---

## Modules and Endpoints

### 1. Provider Module

The Provider Module simulates external APIs, each returning product data in different structures. Key points include:

- Each provider has unique field names and conventions (e.g., `upc` vs. `upc_id`).
- Dynamic pricing is simulated with random values generated between 100 and 500 for each product.
- APIs accept a query parameter `upc` to filter by UPC ID.

#### Provider Endpoints

1. **GET /provider/custom-provider-1?upc={upc_id}**
2. **GET /provider/custom-provider-2?upc={upc_id}**

#### Returned Data Structure

Each provider returns fields such as:

- **UPC ID**: Unique identifier for the product.
- **ID**: Provider-specific external ID.
- **Availability**: Stock status.
- **Price**: Dynamic pricing.
- **Title**: Product name.

### 2. Product Module

The Product Module aggregates and normalizes data from providers. It provides APIs for retrieving current product details, pricing history, and detecting price changes over time.

#### Product Endpoints

1. **GET /products**
   - Returns a list of aggregated products with the current best price based on availability.
   - Simulates dynamic pricing by recalculating prices for each call.

2. **GET /products/:id**
   - Returns detailed information about a specific product.
   - Includes:
     - Current best price.
     - Pricing history.
     - Other normalized product details.

3. **GET /products/changes**
   - Returns products with pricing changes within a specific time period.
   - Supported time ranges:
     - Last 10 seconds.
     - Last minute.
     - Last hour.
   - Pricing details within the selected time range are also included.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the application:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kush96/product-aggregator-nest-js.git .
   ```
2. Ensure Docker CLI is installed on your system.
3. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t product-aggregator .
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 4000:4000 -p 5432:5432 product-aggregator
   ```
   - Two instances will run: one for provider-related APIs and another for product-related APIs.
   - Make sure ports 3000, 4000 and 5432 dont have anything running on your system. 
5. Access the Swagger documentation at:

## Sample Run Instructions

### 1. Test `/products` API

- Call the `/products` API multiple times.
- Observe that the product list remains consistent, but the pricing updates dynamically for each call.

### 2. Test `/products/changes` API

- Call the `/products/changes` API immediately after running the `/products` API.
- Select the desired time range (e.g., last 10 seconds or last minute).
- Verify that the response includes UPC IDs and their respective prices within the selected range.

### 3. Test `/products/:id` API

- Use a UPC ID from the `/products` API response.
- Call the `/products/:id` API with the selected UPC ID.
- Verify that the response includes:
  - Pricing history.
  - Product details.

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Pricing Simulation**: Randomized pricing to mimic real-world fluctuations.
2. **Data Normalization**: Uniform Product DTO structure despite variations in provider data.
3. **Comprehensive Insights**:
   - Best prices across providers.
   - Detailed product information.
   - Historical and recent price changes.

This application is a robust simulation tool for aggregating and normalizing data from multiple inconsistent sources.
